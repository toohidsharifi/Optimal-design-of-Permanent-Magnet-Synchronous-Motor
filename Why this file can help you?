Permanent magnet synchronous motors are a popular option for electric vehicles. The structure of the motor should be optimized to
push the limits of the efficiency of the whole drive to the maximum point. So, the single and multi-objective optimization techniques
were implemented on the motor structure for performance improvement. Various expectations are available in the field of motor
optimization. Torque and cost performances are the most required criterion in most applications. For torque performance, usually
the average torque, torque ripple, and cogging torque are considered. Similarly, the cost performance can be estimated from the 
initial cost and power losses of the motor during operation. So, in most industrial projects and research studies, designers 
attempt to improve them using optimization algorithms. It is essential to mention that there is a vast category for optimization
algorithms, and if we want to choose between them, we might confuse them a little. A reliable optimization algorithm for engineering
applications should have some specifications such as high convergence speed, robustness, and large-scale capability. Considering
all these criteria, we can reliably use the metaheuristic optimization algorithms as they could provide the best solutions for 
benchmark problems and a number of engineering problems [1-5].
